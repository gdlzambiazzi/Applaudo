# Applaudo

This design patter is not the one I prefer.
On a real project (or if I had more time :) ), I would use the cypress-cucumber-preprocessor
and I'd write the scenarios in Gherkin (on a .feature)
and describe these scenarios in .steps (steps definition)
and have the actions and page elements on a Page Objects pattern (.page)
